/**
 * Budget Calculator — pure allocation + meter math (no React, no DB).
 *
 * The calculator has two independent axes: a MODE (Initial Setup vs Mid-flight
 * Reallocation) and a POOL VIEW (Base / Added / Split). The meters, however,
 * are ACCOUNT-GLOBAL per pool: the base meter reflects base committed by
 * pure-base ads AND the base portions of split ads, no matter which tab is on
 * screen. Split is a dual-pool view (both meters), never a third single pool.
 *
 * Currency: everything here is ACTUAL-spend dollars. The only gross figure is
 * the Client Budget input, converted (gross × markup) at the input boundary in
 * computeAllocations — a gross number never reaches a meter.
