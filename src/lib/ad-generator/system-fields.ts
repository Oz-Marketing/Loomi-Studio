 * THE canonical field schema for every ad — the fixed "system fields" a designer
 * binds elements to. This is Phase 1 of collapsing the old model (designers
 * authored arbitrary per-template fields) into one shared schema: designers no
 * longer create/manage fields, they just drag an element and point its value at
 * one of these.
 *
 * Why a fixed set is the right call: everything downstream — the offer engine
 * (`_offer*` tokens), OEM compliance / required fields, the disclaimer token
 * engine, and MarketCheck — already only understands THESE exact keys. A
 * designer-invented field was inert. So making them the single source of truth
 * removes the confusion without losing real capability.
 *
 * Sourced from the vehicle-offer template's field set (the fields the engine
 * already speaks) so there is ONE definition, never a drifting copy.
